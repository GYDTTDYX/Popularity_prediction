<p>We aim to analyze features that makes games popular, so it is
important to make a definition of popular games, we will primarily
adhere to the standard set by Steam[<a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/ivz45n/what_does_the_steam_ratings_like_very_negative_or/"
class="uri">https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/ivz45n/what_does_the_steam_ratings_like_very_negative_or/</a>]
According to Steam’s rating system, we classify games as “popular” if
they are mostly positive, positive, very positive, and overwhelmingly
positive.</p>
<p>However, popularity means more than ratings; it also means a large
player base. To account for this broader perspective of popularity, we
included more criteria:</p>
<p>Estimated Owners: We only include games with estimated-owners more
than 20000 people.</p>
<p>Median Playtime: Games selected for analysis will have a median
playtime exceeding 120 minutes. (This is the latest time that allows
users to get refunds)</p>
<p>By combining ratings, ownership, and playtime information, we could
have a precise definition of “popular games” that fit our
experience.</p>

<div id="price-distribution-of-popular-and-unpopular-games"
class="section level3">
<h3>price distribution of popular and unpopular games</h3>
<p><em>Price summary for popular games</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(pull(df_popular, price))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##    0.49    5.99   12.99   15.21   19.99   99.99</code></pre>

##    0.29    2.59    4.99    8.14    9.99  999.00</code></pre>
<p>Based on tables, it is evident that popular games are more expensive
than less popular games in every quantile. Such difference might caused
by several reasons.</p>
<p><em>Mechanics</em>: Popular games often have complex game mechanics
that improve gaming experience. However, developing such mechanics
requires time, which leads to higher production costs and reflect on the
final price.</p>
<p><em>Animation Effects</em>: The captivating animation effects is a
important component for good games. The creation requires hiring skilled
artists, which will lead to increasing production cost</p>
<p><em>Game Optimization</em>: Popular games need to ensure smooth
gameplay(although we have to admit some popular games still have tons of
bugs). Optimization requires talented coder, which increase the
production cost.</p>
<p>Then, we used statistical test to test whether there is difference in
the two price distribution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>df_unpopular = df_unpopular|&gt;subset(name != &quot;Ascent Free-Roaming VR Experience&quot;)

combined_data = rbind(data.frame(dataset = &quot;unpopular&quot;, price = log(df_unpopular$price)),
                       data.frame(dataset = &quot;popular&quot;, price = log(df_popular$price)))

ggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = price, fill = dataset)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.75)+
  facet_grid(~dataset)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.
## ℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.
## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.
## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning
## was generated.</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploratory_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The two distribution looks approximately normal, so we decide to use
T-test to test whether two groups’s log transformed price have similar
distribution.</p>
<p>H0: they have same mean price H1: they have different mean price</p>
<pre class="r"><code>result &lt;- t.test(log(df_popular$price), log(df_unpopular$price))
result</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  log(df_popular$price) and log(df_unpopular$price)
## t = 52.188, df = 6584.2, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:

## sample estimates:

##  2.343884  1.612050</code></pre>
<p>The result shows a p-value smaller than 0.05, so we reject the null
and conclude that the two groups have different mean price.</p>

<div id="price-distribution-of-games-with-different-estimated-owners"

<h3>price distribution of games with different estimated owners</h3>

<p>From the price distribution plot we could observe a trend that games
with more owners tend to be more expensive. However, we also noticed
that a threshold exist: once a certain numbers of owners is reached, the
prices of games begin to decline.</p>

categories_freq</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploratory_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From the bar plot, it is evident that single-player games have the
highest frequency in our dataset, this is reasonable since multi-player
games require higher optimization, and single player games are the best
choice for independent game maker. The VR-related categories have low
frequency in games, this is because the equipment is expensive and the
technology is relatively new.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>genre_freq = df|&gt;
  separate_rows(genres, sep = &quot;,&quot;)|&gt;
  group_by(genres)|&gt;

genre_freq</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploratory_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>For the bar plot of genre, besides the most frequency keyword indie,
other keywords are common when we talk about games. Sport, Racing,
Action, Adventures includes most of the games genere.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tags_freq = df|&gt;
  separate_rows(tags, sep = &quot;,&quot;)|&gt;

  coord_flip()

tags_freq</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploratory_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As there are too many tags in steam, we only show most frequent tags,
interestingly, we found there are more puzzle games compared to RPG,
this might because the development cost of puzzle games are lower than
RPG.</p>

<p>We could see from the table that there are very few games on steam
before 2006, genre frequency might be strongly affected by randomness in
those years, so we choose only to plot the trend after 2005.</p>

<p><img src="exploratory_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We found some interesting trend from the line plot:</p>
<p><em>Rise of Indie Games</em>: We notice that the genre “indie” has
increased in recent years, particularly after the year 2012. This
increase might caused by more accessible personal computers and no-code
platforms like RPG-maker, which made it easier for independent game
developers to create their games.</p>
<p><em>Shift in Genre Popularity</em>: The line plot also shows a
decreased frequency of Action games. Although we have to admit it is
still one of the most frequent genres, it experienced a decline in
recent years. This shift may be caused by changes in player preferences.
Since most old games are action games, players might seek new genres
when there are available ones. It suggests that players are increasingly
seeking a wider variety of genres.</p>
<p><em>Casual Games on the Rise</em>: We noticed there is an increase in
the frequency of “Casual” games. This reveals that as the first
generation that is familiar with computer gradually enter the job
market, games that are relaxing are preferable for them.</p>
<p><em>Early Access Strategy</em>: The “Early Access” games on Steam
experienced a notable increase. This prosperous new business model in
the game area shows the potential of games.</p>

<p>We can observe differences among the three word-clouds plots:</p>
<p>The tag “difficult” appears more frequently in the word-cloud for
popular and overwhelm popular games. This fit with with reality. Some of
the best games in history, such as Elden Ring and Sekiro: Shadows Die
Twice, are known for their challenging gameplay.</p>
<p>Another interesting difference is the ratio of 2D games to 3D games
is higher in popular games. This is reasonable since small studios may
struggle to allocate sufficient resources to create high-quality 3D
modeling and they might choose to put the budget in mechanics. This
contributes to the higher frequency of 2D games in the popular
category.</p>
